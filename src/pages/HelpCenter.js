      # User Roles and Permissions

      The 5th CRG Admin System uses a role-based access control system to ensure users have appropriate permissions based on their responsibilities.

      ## Access Management Overview

      - **Access User Management** 👥 — Navigate to User Management via the sidebar menu
      - **View User Roles** 📋 — See all users and their assigned roles in the system
      - **Modify Permissions** 🔐 — Administrators can change user roles as needed
      - **Audit Actions** 📊 — Track user activities through the audit log system

      ## Available User Roles

      The system offers four distinct user roles with varying permission levels:

      ### Administrator 👑

      Administrators have complete access to all system functions:

      - **Full System Access** — Can access and modify all areas of the system
      - **User Management** — Can create, edit, and delete user accounts
      - **Role Assignment** — Can assign roles to other users (except Super Admin)
      - **Event Management** — Can create, edit, and delete all events
      - **Activity Management** — Can create, edit, and delete all activities
      - **System Configuration** — Can modify system settings and preferences

      ### Event Manager 📅

      Event Managers have focused permissions for event management:

      Content Editors focus on activity documentation:

      - **Activity Creation** — Can create new activities for existing events
      - **Content Management** — Can upload and manage images for activities
      - **Limited Event Access** — Can view all events but cannot create or edit them
      - **No User Management** — Cannot access user management functions

      - **View Activities** — Can see all activities and their documentation
      - **No Creation Rights** — Cannot create or modify any content
      - **No User Management** — Cannot access user management functions
      - **Basic Reporting** — Can view but not generate reports

      ## Role Assignment Process

      Administrators control role assignments through the User Management section:

      ## Role Transition Process

      When changing a user's role:

      1. Inform the user about the upcoming change
      2. Schedule the role change during non-peak hours
      3. Update the role in the User Management section
      4. Verify the user's access has changed appropriately
      5. Follow up with the user to ensure smooth transition

      ## Security Considerations

      - **Password Policies** — All users must comply with system password requirements
      - **Session Management** — Automatic session timeout for security
      - **Access Logging** — All login attempts are recorded in system logs
      - **Role Separation** — Maintain separation of duties for critical functions

      - **Session Status** — Ensure the user has logged out and back in after role changes
      - **Cache Issues** — Clear browser cache if old permissions persist
      - **Permission Conflict** — Check for conflicting group memberships
      - **System Logs** — Review logs for potential permission errors

      # User Profile Management

        The 5th CRG Admin System restricts profile management to administrators only, ensuring centralized control of user information and permissions.

        ## Administrator-Only Profile Access 🔒

        Profile management in the 5th CRG Admin System follows a strict security protocol:

        - **Restricted Editing** — Only administrators can modify user profile information
        - **Centralized Management** 👥 — All user data changes must go through authorized administrators
        - **Permission Control** 🔐 — Administrators manage all permission changes and role assignments
        - **Change Tracking** 📊 — All profile modifications are logged in the system audit trail

        ## Accessing User Profiles

        Administrators can access and modify user profiles through these steps:

        1. **Navigate to User Management** — Access the User Management section from the sidebar menu
        2. **Locate the User** — Find the specific user in the Users List table
        3. **Open Edit Mode** — Click the edit (pencil) icon in the Actions column
        4. **Modify Profile Data** — Make necessary changes to the user's information
        5. **Save Changes** — Confirm modifications by clicking the "Update User" button

        ## Editable Profile Information

        Administrators can modify the following user profile elements:

        - **Full Name** — Update the user's display name as needed
        - **Department Assignment** — Change the user's department affiliation
        - **User Type** — Upgrade or downgrade between standard User and Admin roles
        - **Account Status** — Manage user access (via the deletion function)

        - **Notification Requirements** — Inform users of their department changes
        - **Data Consistency** — Ensure user assignments align with organizational structure
        - **Documentation** — Record department changes for administrative purposes

        ## User Type Management

        Changing a user's type significantly impacts their system access:

        - **Standard to Admin** — Grants complete system access and user management capabilities
        - **Admin to Standard** — Restricts access to standard view-only operations
        - **Security Considerations** — Each admin user increases potential security exposure
        - **Authentication Requirements** — All role changes require administrator authentication
        - **Verification Process** — System confirms admin privileges before allowing role changes

        ## Self-Service Limitations

        Standard users face the following restrictions:

        - **No Self-Editing** — Users cannot modify their own profile information
        - **View-Only Access** — Users can only view their current profile details
        - **Admin Assistance Required** — All changes must be requested through administrators
        - **System Enforcement** — These restrictions are enforced at the application level
        - **Redirect Security** — Unauthorized access attempts are redirected to the Dashboard

        ## Profile Change Request Process

        When users need profile updates:

        1. **Request Submission** — User contacts an administrator with specific change request
        2. **Administrator Verification** — Admin confirms the legitimacy of the request
        3. **Change Implementation** — Administrator makes the requested changes
        4. **Change Confirmation** — System logs the modification with admin identification
        5. **User Notification** — Administrator informs user when changes are complete

        ## Password Management Policy

        While profile details require administrator intervention, password management follows different rules:

        - **Initial Password** — Administrators set the initial password during account creation
        - **Password Requirements** — System enforces strong password policies
        - **Password Visibility** — Passwords can be temporarily visible during creation for verification
        - **Secure Transmission** — All password data is securely encrypted during transmission
        - **Storage Security** — Passwords are securely hashed in the database

        ## Profile Data Privacy

        The system maintains privacy standards for user information:

        - **Limited Data Collection** — Only essential information is stored in user profiles
        - **Access Controls** — Profile data is accessible only to administrators
        - **Audit Logging** — All access to profile information is recorded
        - **Data Protection** — Profile information is secured against unauthorized access
        - **Compliance Standards** — Information handling follows organizational data policies

        ## Common Profile Management Tasks

        Administrators regularly perform these profile management functions:

        - **Name Corrections** — Fixing typographical errors in user names
        - **Department Transfers** — Moving users between organizational departments
        - **Role Adjustments** — Changing user permissions based on job responsibilities
        - **Account Deactivation** — Temporarily removing system access when needed
        - **Data Verification** — Ensuring profile information remains accurate and current

        ## Best Practices for Profile Management

        When managing user profiles, administrators should:

        - **Verify Identity** — Confirm user identity before making profile changes
        - **Document Changes** — Maintain records of significant profile modifications
        - **Regular Audits** — Review user profiles periodically for accuracy
        - **Consistent Naming** — Follow organizational standards for name formatting
        - **Prompt Response** — Address profile change requests in a timely manner
